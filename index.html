               <h1><b>What is "Coding"?</b></h1>
               <br>
               <h4>Is coding a computer language that we write on some program? Is coding going to be the future of this world? Is coding 
                   helpful to common people , How does it help us? All these questions and many more questions will be answers here about Coding.
               </h4>
               <br>
               <h4 style="text-align: left;">
                   Coding is the writing of computer programs . Those programs are either predefiend or are made by professional coders . Coding does not means the a computer
                   language that we write . Firstly, there are 150+ Coding languages in which you can code . Most famous being <u>Python , Javascript , Java , C# , C ,C++ </u>etc.
                   There are also many softwares in which you can write code . Some of them are <u>Vim , Netbeans , Brackets , Visual Studios </u>etc. We can write any coding language
                   in any of these coding softwares . Almost every thing you see around you is programed using code . Your phone , tablet , laptop , PC , smart televisions
                   every didgital item is programed using codes . even the google would be nothing without coding .Even the phone calls you make are also encoded by coding.
                    Coding's main function is to help us either this way of that, to make the life of people easier . Like  before the smart phones where not owed by every one
                    , It was not a necessity for everyone , but as the time passed it became one of the main part of their lives . Same as that Coding is also going to be a 
                    necessity in future . If you want to do engineering in future and if you have learned Coding you will gurantee get a better post and may better Salary .
                    There is soo much scope in coding right now .

              <h1><b>How to start Coding</b></h1>
              <br>
              <h3 id="age-catogories"><u>For Kids from 4-10 or weak learners</u></h3>
                 <h4 style="text-align: left;">If you are a kid of 4-10 years then you should start from using Code.org even if you have a slow learning speed at the age
                     of 16 then also you can use Code.org . Code.org is a children friendly online tool from which you can start basic block 
                     coding for enhancing your code logic that is very important to learn big codes further ahead . When you will enter the 
                     <a class="article" href="https://code.org" target="_blank">Code.org</a> site you will get many  option for starting block coding
                     first of all you will have to sign up to code.org . You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAvmviMthk" target="_blank">this video</a>
                     to know how to sign up to code.org and then which ever project you will open you will get side by side tutorials on the same 
                     web tool . The most good part is this is completely free! . I have been personally using code.org in my starting periods of coding .
                     You should practise and learn what each code block  for atleast 2-3 months . After you have done using code.org there is one  more 
                     web tool same of block coding that you will have to use to enhance your coding skills further . That is <a href="https://thunkable.com/" target="_blank">Thunkable</a>
                     . It is also a block coding platform but a bit more difficult and complex then  code.org . You might get problem finding out but there are
                     always youtube tutorials that  may help you out . There are also starter tutorials in the web tool that you can get help from. In thunkable
                     also you will have to sign up , you may watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euO3ROXkTiI" target="_blank">this video</a> to
                     get help how to sign in to thunkable . Thunkable will help you built the logic that is needed for coding and help you a bit better when 
                     you start doing text coding .
                     <br>
                    </h4>
                     <h3 id="age-catogories"><u>kids aged 10+ that are beginners for coding</u></h3>

                     <h4 style="text-align: left;">If you are a kid aged 10 or above 10 then you may start from learning HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) , CSS
                         (Cascading Style Sheet) , Js(Java Script) . These are the coding languages that together form a well working webpage.
                         Every webpage you visit is made up of these three coding languages . Even the website you are reading right now .
                         You can download application like Visual Studios , Brackets to start writing these languages . You will have to get the help of
                         google or youtube to find out how to start writing in these languages . HTML is used for adding the raw elemenents in the 
                         screen like text , images , lines etc. CSS is used for adding beauty to the raw elements like designing them , for example their 
                         height , width , color etc. Js is used for adding  functions to the webpage for example when you click a button the color of the screen
                         changes etc. You can also start learning Python or Java . Python and Java are the most popular coding languages and are very useful too.
                         You can start coding Phyton or Java in any coding application . I recommend usind visual studios , or brackets that i have personnaly been 
                         using .

                    And with a separate panel that both instructs and shows your mistakes, it's the next best thing to having a private coding tutor right beside you.

                        and algorithmic thinking - to generate creative outcomes like animations and apps.I have been personnaly using this and I say that its a bit over price for 
                        Middle class families but the knowledge they give is wonderful . It is a 1:1 live online class with a teacher that teaches you and clears very single doubt that you
                        have . If you want to learn coding and you can afford it then from my opinion its the best website to learn coding online .
